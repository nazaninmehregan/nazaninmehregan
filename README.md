## 🚀 My Journey in AI  
  
As a **Data Scientist** and **Machine Learning Engineer**, with an MSc in Computer Science and experience across **industry and research**, I design and deploy **AI systems that move beyond prototypes into production**.

I am passionate about using AI to solve complex challenges and create positive outcomes across various fields. My background includes impactful projects in **GenAI and document intelligence**—where I've fine-tuned LLMs, trained NLP models like BERT for document classification, built intelligent agents using LangChain and LangGraph, and developed RAG systems with Neo4j that enhance accuracy by 20-35%. My interest in AI extends to any domain where data insights and machine learning can drive innovation, from crowd safety systems and 5G network optimization to mentoring the next generation of ML practitioners and beyond.
