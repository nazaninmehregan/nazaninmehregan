## 🚀 My Journey in AI  
With an MSc in Computer Science and experience across **industry and research**, I design and deploy **AI systems that move beyond prototypes into production**.  
- Built **RAG pipelines** and containerized NLP workflows, boosting LLM accuracy by 20–35%.  
- Designed **heterogeneous GNNs** for 5G vehicular networks, cutting handovers by 60% and improving signal quality by 11.5%.  
- Developed **CrowdGuard**, an award-winning real-time system for crowd safety using YOLOv8, ByteTrack, and CSRNet.  

I thrive at the intersection of **research rigor and real-world impact**—mentoring teams, optimizing models, and deploying GenAI solutions at scale.
